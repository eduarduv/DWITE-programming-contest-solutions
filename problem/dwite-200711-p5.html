<div id="problem_title">Bridges In A Graph</div>

<p>
A <strong>graph</strong> is a collection of nodes, called <strong>vertices</strong>, connected to each other in some fashion by <strong>edges</strong>. A graph is called <strong>connected</strong> if it is possible to find a path along edges from every point to every other point.
</p>
<p>
Below are two graphs:
</p>
<img src="graph_1.png" alt="first set of graphs" />
<p>
One on the left is <em>connected</em>, while the one on the right is <em>not connected</em> (there is no path from node 1 to node 3).
</p>
<p>
An edge of a graph is called a <strong>bridge</strong> if by removing that edge the graph is no longer connected.
</p>
<p>
Edge 1-2 in the following graph is a bridge, since by removing it, the graph is no longer connected (no path from node 1 to any other node):

<p>
Edge 2-3 however, is not a bridge:
</p>
<img src="graph_3.png" alt="third set of graphs" />

<p>
You are tasked with finding the number of edges, in a graph, that are bridges. You will be given 5 connected graphs, and you will output 5 single integers for the number of bridges found in graphs.
</p>

<p>
The input file is <strong>DATA5.txt</strong>. First line will contain a single integer N, number of vertices. Vertices will be numbered 1 to N. 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100 . Second line will contain a single integer M, number of edges. 0 &lt;= M &lt;= 1000 . Followed by M lines, each describing an edge. An edge is described by two integers, separated by a space. All edges are valid. This format will be repeated 5 times (that is, a line after the last edge of the 1st graph, will be a single integer, describing a number of vertices in the 2nd graph).
</p>
<p>
The output file <strong>OUT5.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, a single integer per line -- the number of bridges in the described graph.</p>

        Explanation of Input:
        <pre>
6 - There are 6 vertices, numbered 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 - There are 7 edges
1 2 - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2
1 3 - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 3
1 4 - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 4
1 5 - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 5
3 5 - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 5
6 2 - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 2
6 1 - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 1
